# ChernovIncidentGame
In the game you are playing as an intern in the Chernov Nuclear Reactor. Some fault in the reactor control panel triggers an emergency that in 10 minutes will blow the whole thing up. Your only help is to solve the puzzles by calling the auto-reply phone agent which will help you navigate through the puzzles.
